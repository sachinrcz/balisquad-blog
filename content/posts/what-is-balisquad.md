BaliSquad is a community-driven platform to discover and host events happening across Bali.

It brings together people who want to learn, connect, and do things in real life whether that’s building projects, exploring ideas, learning new skills, or meeting like-minded people.

Instead of relying on scattered Instagram posts, private WhatsApp groups, or word of mouth, BaliSquad puts events in one public place that anyone can access.

One place to see what’s happening.
One place to share events.
One place to show up.

## Why BaliSquad exists

Bali has a vibrant community scene, but it is fragmented.

Events are often:

* Shared only in closed groups
* Easy to miss if you are new
* Lost quickly on social media

BaliSquad exists to make events:

* Easy to discover
* Open to everyone
* Visible beyond a single post or story

The goal is simple: help people find the right events and help organizers reach the right people.

## Who is BaliSquad for?

If you are looking to:

* Meet new people

## What BaliSquad is not

BaliSquad is not:

* A spam-filled event board

It is built for real people, real gatherings, and real connections.

---

## The bigger picture

BaliSquad aims to be:

* A public home for Bali’s communities and events
* A trusted place to discover what’s happening
* A bridge between people, not just a list of dates

If you care about showing up, learning, and meeting people in real life, BaliSquad is for you.
